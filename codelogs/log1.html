	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
    <p>Non-semantic tags are generic containers that carry no meaning about the content they hold, they exist mainly for styling or grouping.
        <br>Semantic tags describe the purpose and role of the content, giving it clear meaning to browsers, search engines, and screen readers.
        <br>The key difference is that semantic tags communicate what the content is (e.g., navigation, main content, sidebar), while non-semantic tags only say how it should be grouped or styled.</p>
    <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They improve accessibility by helping screen readers understand and navigate the page structure more effectively.</li>
        <li>They boost SEO because search engines can better interpret the content hierarchy and context of the page.</li>
        <li>They make code more readable and maintainable since the tag names instantly show the purpose of each section.</li>
        <li>They provide better future-proofing and consistency across browsers and devices by following modern web standards.</li>
        <li>They enable more meaningful default behaviors in browsers and assistive tools (e.g., jumping to main content or landmark regions).</li>
    </ul>
